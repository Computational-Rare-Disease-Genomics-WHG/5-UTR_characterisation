# Differences in 5'untranslated regions highlight the importance of translational regulation of dosage sensitive genes

The following repository contains the code accompany paper "Differences in 5'untranslated regions highlight the importance of translational regulation of dosage sensitive genes" and contains scripts to reproduce our figures.

We recommend installing the following packages used in our RMarkdown scripts prior to reproducing the results. 

```R

packages <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "ggrepel", "ggthemes", "ggalt", "stringr", "tidyverse", "splitstackshape", "BiocManager", "gridExtra", "grid", "ape", "seqinr")

# Install CRAN Packages
install.packages(packages)

# Install Bioconductor Packages
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicScores", "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38", "BSgenome"))

# Install remote packages.
remotes::install_github('jorvlan/raincloudplots')
```

To download the data, we recommend install `wget`, `bgzip` and installing `gsutils` (as per the instructions provided by Google, which can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)). 

`download_all.sh` downloads MANE v1 and gnomAD exomes 2.1.1 constraint metrics. 

## R markdown analysis files: 

1. MANE 5'UTR analysis
2. 5'UTR composition analysis
3. 5'UTRs across LEOUF
4. 5'UTRs of disease genes

The folder `5-UTR_char` contains all data used by and generated by the markdown files
